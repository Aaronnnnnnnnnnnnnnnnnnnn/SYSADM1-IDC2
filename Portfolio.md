**Course Reflection**

What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet,
exceed, or fall short of these expectations?

-My initial expectations for the course are by going over the fundamentals of how systems operate and going through servers more as they were taught last semester. This course exceeded my expectations since the learnings that I want was covered in this subject. Furthermore, my objectives were to learn about the inner workings of system administrator and acquire useful abilities for server management.

What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did
these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?

- My expectations were not only met, but exceeded by the course. It covered a wide range of topics, such as what an system administration is, about the different kinds of servers (web servers), different services of servers, git, and also Linux server management. These contributed to my understanding and comprehensive learning experience was offered by the combination of practical applications and in-depth academic understanding.

Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective
strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course
material?

- During my learning process, I discovered that a combination of theoretical research and real-world application was necessary to fully understand the difficult ideas. By troubleshooting servers and trying out different servers and their services, I was able to absorb the ideas and comprehend how they applied to actual situations.

Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that
significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they
effective?

- The troubleshooting tasks that were needed to resolve issues and the activities that we did in our laboratory time like the virtual machines were the most influential. These tasks helped me improve my troubleshooting skills and reinforce my comprehension by requiring me to apply theoretical concepts to solve real-world challenges.

Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course? How
did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from them?

- I did encounter some problems during this course like the Midterm Exams where we were needed to set up a server and its DHCP using Powershell. I also have trouble in our hands-on tasks since I feel pressured.

Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it
promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or
decision-making?

- Through the presentation of complex scenarios requiring the evaluation of various troubleshooting scenarios, the course placed a strong emphasis on critical thinking. Using trade-off evaluation and system performance signs to inform decisions improved my ability to tackle problems carefully and critically.

Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or
perspectives did you gain from this course?

- Reflecting on my personal growth, I acquired technical skills and also developed resilience in the face of challenging concepts. This experience deepened my appreciation for the meticulous design required in operating systems and enhanced my problem-solving abilities.

How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your
future studies, career, or personal life?

- My future profession will greatly benefit from the knowledge I have received in this course, especially in the areas of system administration, troubleshooting, and server management. With this firm foundation, I can contribute successfully to complicated server environments and make educated decisions, whether I'm managing a server or troubleshooting an error.
